 * Also contains the variables defined as global and the definitions of functions to be used when the code is running.
 *
 * During creation phase, all the global variables and functions are HOISTED, i.e., it setups the memory space for those
 * functions and variables.
 *
 * When a function is invoked, a new execution context is stacked in the execution stack, this new execution context is
 * similar to the global execution context, so the outer environment is the context where that function lives, mainly is

 * ASYNCHRONOUS CALLBACKS
 * 
 * Javascript is synchronous and single threaded. To achieve asynchronous calls, Javascipt engine has a queue called
 * Event Queue. This queue is evaluated periodically by Javascript engine and an event is going to be attended/executed
 * when the execution stack is empty. So, Javascript is not really asynchronus with this approach (as mentioned, it is
 * synchronus and single threaded), what is really happening is that the browser is putting/stacking events
 * asynchronously in the Event Queue while code is running line by line.

/***********************************************************************************************************************
 * COERCION AND DEFAULT VALUES
 * 
 * Coercion refers to convert a value from one type to another and is a common behavior in Javascript because dynamic
 * typing of the language. It can be dangerous in some scenarios. To avoid the coercion in the comparisons between two 
 * values, it is recommended use the strictly equality or inequality operator (===). Coercion can be used as an 
 * advantage to verify lack of existence in if statements.
 *
 * Javascript does not care if you donâ€™t pass the parameters for a function, unlike another programming languages. This
 * is because Javascript set the parameters with the default value 'undefined'. But sometimes this behavior is not
 * desired or it is needed to set an specific default value. To set default values, the best practice is the usage of 
 * the operator || (see example below).
 *
 **********************************************************************************************************************/

if (isOk)

// Also is possible to force coercion using the primitive types of Javascript as follows
Boolean("Hello");       // The value "Hello" is coerced to true
Number("haha");         // The value "haha" is coerced to NaN
String(undefined);      // The value undefined is coerced to "undefined"

// Initially, name is set with 'undefined' value.
function greet(name)
{
    // This is another example of coercion. The operator || returns true or false if the parameters passed are booleans,
    // but if not so, it returns the value that can be coerced to true. In this case, if name is undefined, || is going
    // to return '<Your name here>'.
    name = name || '<Your name here>';

/***********************************************************************************************************************
 * OBJECTS
 *
 * Objects in Javascript are similar to another programming languages, they have properties and methods. But in
 * Javascript specifically, an object is a collection of pairs name-value, where the pairs can be properties and
 * functions.
 *
 * A way to create an object is using the constructor new Object(): var obj = new Object(); obj.prop1 = "value";
 *
 * Another way to create an object is using the literal syntax as follows: var obj = { prop1: "value" };
 *
 * To access/create properties and methods in an object, you can use [] and dot operator. Mainly, dot operator is more
 * redable and usable.
 *
 **********************************************************************************************************************/

// Creating an object with new Object() constructor. At this point, person is an empty object.
var person = new Object();

// Properties can be created/accessed with [] operator passing the name of the property to be created/accessed.
person["firstname"] = "Darwing";
person["lastname"] = "Zenfy";

// Also, you can pass a variable to [] operator that contains the name of the property that you want to access.
var firstNameProperty = "firstname";
console.log(person[firstNameProperty]);

// Also, you can use the dot operator to access the properties and methods for an object.
console.log(person.firstname);
console.log(person.lastname);

// Unlike other programming languages, this does not throw an error, this returns undefined. This means that you can
// always add properties and functions on the fly for an object.
console.log(person.address);

// Objects can be inside of another objects.
person.address = new Object();
person.address.street = "14-1 Venezuela St.";
person.address.city = "Caracas";
person.address.state = "DF";

// Creating a function for the object.
person.printFullName = function (greeting)
{
    greeting = greeting || "Hello";

    // In this case, this is not pointing to the global object but to the person object. This can be confused.

console.log(person.address.street);
console.log(person.address.city);

// function (and to pass the parameters). person["printFullName"] it just returs the code of the function.
person["printFullName"];
console.log(person["printFullName"]);

// Correct way to invoke functions in objects using [] operator.
person["printFullName"]();

// Object literal declaration. Actually, this way is the most used, because is more redable and easier to write.
