 * OBJECTS
 *
 * Objects in Javascript are similar to another programming languages, they have properties and methods. But in

 *
 * A way to create an object is using the constructor new Object(): var obj = new Object(); obj.prop1 = "value";
 *
 * Another way to create an object is using the literal syntax as follows: var obj = { prop1: "value" };
 *
 * To access/create properties and methods in an object, you can use [] and dot operator. Mainly, dot operator is more
 * redable and usable.
 *

// Also, you can use the dot operator to access the properties and methods for an object.

 * FUNCTIONS
 *
 * In Javascript, functions are objects. A function is a special type of object with a property called 'name' that is
 * the name of the function and a property called 'code' that contains the code of the function and it is invokable.
 * Also it contains another important properties and methods, this is going to be covered later.
 * 
 * Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions: Assign them to variables, pass them around, create
 * them on the fly. This is because functions are objects. Even, you can declare anonymous functions in Javascript. This
 * is called First Class Functions.
 *
 * During the creation of the execution context of a function, Javascript creates a variable called 'arguments'. This
 * variable contains all the parameters passed to the function in an array.
 *
 * ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Objects (including functions) interact by reference when sending them equal to each other or 
 * passing to a function (see examples below). Instead, primitives always interact by value.
 *
 * ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Javascript does not support function overloading, because functions are objects.

 * CLOSURES
 *
 * Closures are important in Javascript because they allow important design patterns. But initially it is hard to

 * to all variables that were declared at the time the function was created. Due to hoisting, named functions have the
 * scope present at the top of whatever block they belong to, but anonymous functions have whatever scope exists at the 
 * line they are initialized (see examples to understand better).
 *
 * So, a closure is the act of capturing a value or an object and separating it from its original scope, making it
 * available to the capturing function forever.
 *
 * Closures are related to the Scope Chain, because when a variable is used, the engine finds out through the scope
 * chain until it finds the entry for that variable. The way of separating a variable from its previous existence in the
 * scope chain is achieved through redeclaring the variable or passing it into a function, and this is a common behavior
 * in the closures.
