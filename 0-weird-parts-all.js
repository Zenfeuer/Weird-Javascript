 * Also contains the variables defined as global and the definitions of functions to be used when the code is running.
 *
 * During creation phase, all the global variables and functions are HOISTED, i.e., it setups the memory space for those
 * functions and variables.
 *
 * When a function is invoked, a new execution context is stacked in the execution stack, this new execution context is
 * similar to the global execution context, so the outer environment is the context where that function lives, mainly is
 * the global execution context.

 * when the execution stack is empty. So, Javascript is not really asynchronus with this approach (as mentioned, it is

 * COERCION AND DEFAULT VALUES

 * values, it is recommended use the strictly equality or inequality operator (===). Coercion can be used as an 
 * advantage to verify lack of existence in if statements.
 *
 * Javascript does not care if you donâ€™t pass the parameters for a function, unlike another programming languages. This
 * is because Javascript set the parameters with the default value 'undefined'. But sometimes this behavior is not
 * desired or it is needed to set an specific default value. To set default values, the best practice is the usage of 
 * the operator || (see example below).
 *
 **********************************************************************************************************************/

if (isOk)

// Also is possible to force coercion using the primitive types of Javascript as follows
Boolean("Hello");       // The value "Hello" is coerced to true
Number("haha");         // The value "haha" is coerced to NaN
String(undefined);      // The value undefined is coerced to "undefined"

// Initially, name is set with 'undefined' value.
function greet(name)
{
    // This is another example of coercion. The operator || returns true or false if the parameters passed are booleans,
    // but if not so, it returns the value that can be coerced to true. In this case, if name is undefined, || is going
    // to return '<Your name here>'.
    name = name || '<Your name here>';

 * OBJECTS
 *
 * Objects in Javascript are similar to another programming languages, they have properties and methods. But in
 * Javascript specifically, an object is a collection of pairs name-value, where the pairs can be properties and
 * functions.
 *
 * A way to create an object is using the constructor new Object(): var obj = new Object(); obj.prop1 = "value";
 *
 * Another way to create an object is using the literal syntax as follows: var obj = { prop1: "value" };
 *
 * To access/create properties and methods in an object, you can use [] and dot operator. Mainly, dot operator is more
 * redable and usable.
 *
 **********************************************************************************************************************/

// Creating an object with new Object() constructor. At this point, person is an empty object.
var person = new Object();

// Properties can be created/accessed with [] operator passing the name of the property to be created/accessed.
person["firstname"] = "Darwing";
person["lastname"] = "Zenfy";

// Also, you can pass a variable to [] operator that contains the name of the property that you want to access.
var firstNameProperty = "firstname";
console.log(person[firstNameProperty]);

// Also, you can use the dot operator to access the properties and methods for an object.
console.log(person.firstname);
console.log(person.lastname);

// Unlike other programming languages, this does not throw an error, this returns undefined. This means that you can
// always add properties and functions on the fly for an object.
console.log(person.address);

// Objects can be inside of another objects.
person.address = new Object();
person.address.street = "14-1 Venezuela St.";
person.address.city = "Caracas";
person.address.state = "DF";

// Creating a function for the object.
person.printFullName = function (greeting)
{
    greeting = greeting || "Hello";

    // In this case, this is not pointing to the global object but to the person object. This can be confused.

}

console.log(person.address.street);
console.log(person.address.city);

// function (and to pass the parameters). person["printFullName"] it just returs the code of the function.
person["printFullName"];
console.log(person["printFullName"]);

// Correct way to invoke functions in objects using [] operator.
person["printFullName"]();

// Note that this throws an error, because at this point Darwing variable is undefined. 
//greetPerson(Darwing);

// Object literal declaration. Actually, this way is the most used, because is more redable and easier to write.

    firstname: 'Darwing', 
    lastname: 'Zenfy',

/***********************************************************************************************************************
 * FUNCTIONS
 *
 * In Javascript, functions are objects. A function is a special type of object with a property called 'name' that is
 * the name of the function and a property called 'code' that contains the code of the function and it is invokable.
 * Also it contains another important properties and methods, this is going to be covered later.
 * 
 * Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions: Assign them to variables, pass them around, create
 * them on the fly. This is because functions are objects. Even, you can declare anonymous functions in Javascript. This
 * is called First Class Functions.
 *
 * During the creation of the execution context of a function, Javascript creates a variable called 'arguments'. This
 * variable contains all the parameters passed to the function in an array.
 *
 * ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Objects (including functions) interact by reference when sending them equal to each other or 
 * passing to a function (see examples below). Instead, primitives always interact by value.
 *
 * ** IMPORTANT NOTE: Javascript does not support function overloading, because functions are objects.

 * CLOSURES
 *
 * Closures are important in Javascript because they allow important design patterns. But initially it is hard to

 * to all variables that were declared at the time the function was created. Due to hoisting, named functions have the
 * scope present at the top of whatever block they belong to, but anonymous functions have whatever scope exists at the 
 * line they are initialized (see examples to understand better).
 *
 * So, a closure is the act of capturing a value or an object and separating it from its original scope, making it
 * available to the capturing function forever.
 *
 * Closures are related to the Scope Chain, because when a variable is used, the engine finds out through the scope
 * chain until it finds the entry for that variable. The way of separating a variable from its previous existence in the
 * scope chain is achieved through redeclaring the variable or passing it into a function, and this is a common behavior
 * in the closures.

 * is used by function constructors. This is a CONFUSING name, because the 'prototype' property of a function IS NOT the

var x3 = new Number();    // A new Number object

var x5 = new Array();     // A new Array object
var x6 = new RegExp();    // A new RegExp object
var x7 = new Function();  // A new Function object
var x8 = new Date();      // A new Date object


// This works because Javascript engine boxed it inside of a string object which has this 'length' property and another

var b = new Number(3);  // A Number object

// In this case, == operator converts the operands to the same type (coercion), so in the end the expression is true.
console.log(a == b); // true

// Because strict equality does not make type conversion, this return false. This is where built-in function 
// constructors can be dangerous, this can be hard to debug.
console.log(a === b); // false

/// Dangerous Aside for Arrays

// NOTE: Arrays in Javascript are also objects! Because of that, you can modify the prototype property and add new
// properties and method and this can be dangerous if you loop the array with 'for..in' statement. See the example.

var arr = ['Luke', 'Leia', 'Anakin'];
