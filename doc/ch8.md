# Function Execution

The code property of a function is invokable. When a function is invoked, it creates a new execution context that is stacked at the top of the execution stack.

When an execution context is created, the variable 'this' is going to point a different thing depending on how the function is invoked. There are a few scenarios where 'this' will be changed depending on how the function is called.
