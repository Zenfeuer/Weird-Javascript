# Coercion and Default Values

Coercion refers to convert a value from one type to another and is a common behavior in Javascript because dynamic typing of the language. It can be dangerous in some scenarios. To avoid the coercion in the comparisons between two values, it is recommended use the strictly equality or inequality operator (===). Coercion can be used as an advantage to verify lack of existence in if statements.

Javascript does not care if you donâ€™t pass the parameters for a function, unlike another programming languages. This is because Javascript set the parameters with the default value 'undefined'. But sometimes this behavior is not desired or it is needed to set an specific default value. To set default values, the best practice is the usage of the operator || (see example below).
