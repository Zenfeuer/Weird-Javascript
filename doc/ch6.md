# Objects

Objects in Javascript are similar to another programming languages, they have properties and methods. But in Javascript specifically, an object is a collection of pairs name-value, where the pairs can be properties and functions.

A way to create an object is using the constructor new Object(): var obj = new Object(); obj.prop1 = "value";

Another way to create an object is using the literal syntax as follows: var obj = { prop1: "value" };

To access/create properties and methods in an object, you can use [] and dot operator. Mainly, dot operator is more readable and usable.
