# Closures

Closures are important in Javascript because they allow important design patterns. But initially it is hard to understand. The root of the problem is that functions have a state (scope of the function) and it stores references to all variables that were declared at the time the function was created. Due to hoisting, named functions have the scope present at the top of whatever block they belong to, but anonymous functions have whatever scope exists at the line they are initialized (see examples to understand better).

So, a closure is the act of capturing a value or an object and separating it from its original scope, making it available to the capturing function forever.

Closures are related to the Scope Chain, because when a variable is used, the engine finds out through the scope chain until it finds the entry for that variable. The way of separating a variable from its previous existence in the scope chain is achieved through redeclaring the variable or passing it into a function, and this is a common behavior in the closures.
